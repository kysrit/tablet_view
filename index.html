                    Carlos is a blue parakeet/budgerigar that my older sister adopted from her friend in high school. Carlos is 9 years old and loves flying around the kitchen and standing on chandeliers. She has very loud chirps and loves to chatter when people play instruments. Although she can be aggressive at times and is very unfriendly towards strangers, she has a very soft bite.

                    Carlos has a sister named Einstein. We did not discover the genders of our pet birds until years after we named them. At night, Carlos always sleeps on her favorite yellow swing and will wake up in the same spot every morning in the upstairs of her cage ready to come out and play.

                    Rocky is a 5 year old corgi. He prefers going for a jog than lounging around the house. He’s full of energy and loves to show his affection by snuggling up next to me while watching some Netflix.

                    One thing I definitely overlooked when we got Rocky was the amount this little guy could shed! I spent an hour vacuuming our carpet floors just the day after he entered our homes! However, I would vacuum up and down the walls of our home for him, my life-long pal and good boy.
